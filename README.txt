Documentation:
compile_and_run.sh : Use this script to compile all sources and run the server and client. It relies on an ActiveMQ broker instance running locally, using the default ports (the url used is tcp://localhost:61616"). The client will start a GUI that lets you subscribe/unsubscribe from the different stock quotes. 

Each subfolder (tuJmsClient, tuJmsServer) includes separate scripts to build and run the server or client independently.
